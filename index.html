    <p>Contentment is a state of self-satisfaction that comes from one's own position. A man's hunger for more and more is what drives him to reach his goals. Discontentment leads to a new journey and a restless life. He doesn't know how long it will last until he reaches his ultimate goal. Though it is an innate virtue, contentment can be developed. To maintain a peaceful mind, we must accept the things that happen in life and remain unperturbed.</p>
